# Applied Power

Economy bar that focuses on how much metal is being spent, and what is limiting that spending.

## Status

Effectively early access.  Expect things to be recolored, moved, removed, or introduced. There is still a fair bit of information design to do, but the major themes are in place.

## Major features

Inspired by Elodea's [Easy cookie cutter planetary annihilation build order #7 DIY edition](https://forums.uberent.com/threads/cookie-cutter-builds-for-new-players.59452/#post-1059439)

- Central location given to spent metal (applied power)
- Metal and energy arranged in pipelines
- Limiting factor highlighted

## Elements (2015-03-10)

The element that is currently limiting spent metal/applied build power is highlighted with a red background and yellow outline.

Demand are 'pipes', pairs of white lines. Supplies are 'flows', represented by solid colors.

### Left (metal) side:

[Estimated Build Power]-ditto-[Energy Efficiency]-Metal Demand-[Metal Supply]-supply & demand-[Metal Storage]-spent & demand-[Build Efficiency]

### Center:

*Spent Metal*

### Right (energy) side:

[Energy/Metal]-spent & demand-[Energy Storage]-supply & demand-[Energy Supply]-demand-[Energy Demand]

Minor numbers:
- Energy Supply/Metal Supply: do you have enough energy for the metal you have
- Energy Demand/Build Power: what you target the supply ratio to

## Notable Missing Features

Does not account for shared economy.

## Conflicts

Any other mod which replaces the economy/status bar
